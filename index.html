      <p>Hi, I'm Bruno Torres, a Software Engineer based in Rio de Janeiro.</p>
      <p>Currently, I work at <a href="http://globo.com">globo.com</a>, which is part of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Grupo_Globo">one of the largest media groups in the world</a>.</p>
      <p>Coding is both my job and my hobby, as well as video games, both playing and developing. You can check some of my work in my <a href="https://github.com/towerz">github account</a>.</p>
      <p>Other interests include UX (for whatever platform: mobile, TVs, consoles, etc), operating systems and programming languages.</p>
      <p>I plan to present here a little bit of what I've done and what I'm doing right now.</p>
